\section{The relationship between the number of training examples, $k$, and accuracy}
The following two graph shows the relationship between training examples and accuracy:
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{center}
   \begin{tabular}{c}

    \begin{minipage}{0.5\hsize}
     \begin{center}
     \scalebox{0.33}
      {\includegraphics[]{figure_1.png}}
   
      \caption{The relationship between the number of training examples and accuracy. The value of $k$ is fixed to $3$. }
      \label{fig:corpus_size}
     \end{center}
    \end{minipage}

    \begin{minipage}{0.01\hsize}
    \end{minipage}

    \begin{minipage}{0.5\hsize}
     \begin{center}
      \scalebox{0.33}
      {\includegraphics[]{figure_2.png}}
      \caption{\label{k_and_accuracy}The relationship between $k$ and accuracy. The value of the number of training examples is fixed to $500$}
     \end{center}
    \end{minipage}

  \end{tabular}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}

As the number of training examples increases, the higher the accuracy becomes.
The zig-zag observed in Figure \ref{k_and_accuracy} is partly because when the value of $k$ is an even number, then the median returns an answer in decimals (i.e. a label that is not an integer between $0$ and $9$), which causes median tie-breaker to be less reliable. Therefore, the accuracy is generally low when $k$ is an even number.

\section{What numbers get confused with each other most easily?}

By fixing $k = 3$, no matter what the number of training examples is, the classification of $4$ and $9$ easily gets confused. 
Specifically, the test examples that are labeled $4$ are mistakenly classified as $9$.
% few due to the use of the median function to break ties.
% TODO: probably better to have a table here?
Let $limit$ be the number of training examples. 
By further analyzing the possible causes of misclassification, the median tie-breaker between $4$ and $9$ happened the most ($72$ times) when $k = 3$ and $limit = 500$. 
It is possible that the median tie-breaker is causing many misclassifications, because if all of median tie-breaker is causing misclassification, then it covers around half ($72/155$) of the total number of misclassified examples between $4$ and $9$. 
However, we did some further investigation on larger $k$ and larger $limit$. 
When $k = 19$ and $limit = 5000$, the median tie-breaker happened only $8$ times and $62$ test examples of the number $4$ are misclassified as $9$.

In conclusion, the median tie-breaker does not contribute a lot to the most misclassified test examples of $4$ and $9$, and we infer that the misclassification is mainly caused by having a similar strcuture.
